Diamond App: Elevate Your Luxury Experience ✨

Step into a realm where sophistication converges with cutting-edge technology. 
Diamond App redefines high-end shopping by seamlessly blending timeless elegance,
ensuring every purchase is authenticated and eternally secure.

## 💎⚙️Getting Started(Project structure & State management logic)

Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, with layers like domain, data, and presentation.
Bloc is a state management library that helps manage the flow of data and state changes in Flutter apps.

The user probably wants to integrate these two concepts to build a scalable and maintainable app. 
They might be a developer or tech lead looking to structure their project properly. The Diamond App is about luxury shopping, 
so the architecture needs to handle things like authentication, data fetching, and state management efficiently.

First, I should outline the layers of Clean Architecture.
Then explain how Bloc fits into the presentation layer. 
Maybe use the Diamond App's features as examples. 
For instance, Getting Diamond's from DataSet could use Bloc to manage the DataSet state, interacting with use cases in the domain layer, 
which in turn talk to repositories in the data layer.

I need to mention the benefits: testability, separation of concerns, scalability.
Also, how Bloc's event-driven approach helps in managing complex UI states.
Perhaps provide a code example for a feature like fetching exclusive collections, showing the Bloc, use case, and repository interaction.
